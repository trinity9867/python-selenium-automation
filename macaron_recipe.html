 <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <li>1 3/4 cups of confectionery sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
    <li>3 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
    <li>Pinch of sal</li>
    <li>1/4 cup superfine sugar</li>
    <li>2 to 3 drops gel food coloring (see options below)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla, almond or mint extract</li>
    <li>Assorted fillings (see options below)</li>


<h2>Directions:</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment. <br>Measure sugar and almond flour by spooning them into measuring cups and leveling with knife.
        <br>Transfer to a bowl; whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Sift the sugar-almond flour mixture, a little at a time, through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing with a rubber spatula to pass through as much as possible. <br> It will take a while, and up to 2 tablespoons of coarse almond flour may be left; save for another use.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt with a mixer on medium speed until frothy. <br> Increase the speed to medium high; gradually add the superfine sugar and beat until stiff and shiny, about 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the beaten egg whites to the bowl with the almond flour mixture. <br> Fold in the egg whites by drawing a rubber spatula halfway through the mixture and folding until incorporated, giving the bowl a quarter turn with each fold.</li>
        <li>Add the desired food coloring and extract (see below). <br>Continue folding and turning, scraping down the bowl, until the batter is smooth and falls off the spatula in a thin flat ribbon, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. <br>Holding the bag vertically and close to the baking sheet, pipe 1 1/4-inch circles (24 per sheet). <br>Firmly tap the baking sheets twice against the counter to release any air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Let the cookies sit at room temperature until the tops are no longer sticky to the touch, 15 minutes to 1 hour, <br>depending on the humidity. Slip another baking sheet under the first batch (a double baking sheet protects the cookies from the heat).</li>
        <li>Bake the first batch until the cookies are shiny and rise 1/8 inch to form a "foot," 12 to 14 minutes. <br> Transfer to a rack to cool completely. <br>Repeat, using a double sheet for each batch. <br>Peel the cookies off the mats and sandwich with a thin layer of filling</li>
        <li>Tint the batter with 2 drops neon pink gel food coloring; <br>flavor with almond extract. <br>Fill with seedless raspberry jam (you'll need about 3/4 cup).</li>


    </ol>
